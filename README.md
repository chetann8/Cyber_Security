Student Cryptographic Assist Website


In this project, I developed a website that facilitates user registration and login, specifically 
designed for engineering students at Presidency University. The website utilizes MySQL for 
storing user data securely.

To ensure exclusivity, users can only register with their official university email addresses, 
thereby preventing the use of common email providers such as Gmail or Yahoo. The registration 
process includes advanced password requirements to ensure security: passwords must meet 
specific length criteria, include necessary symbols, and avoid characters such as commas, 
hyphens, and equals. Additionally, passwords cannot be identical to the user's name to prevent 
guessability. A live feedback system provides users with real-time assessments of their password 
strength.

Once registered, users can log in using their credentials, which are verified against the database. 
Upon successful login, users are redirected to the homepage, where they have access to various 
cipher tools. These tools allow users to perform encryption and decryption with ciphers such as 
Affine, Atbash, Rail Fence, and Caesar. The RSA cipher is available for encryption, with an 
automatic decryption feature that returns the original message.
In summary, we have created a secure, user-friendly cryptographic assistant website tailored for 
engineering students at Presidency University. This platform not only ensures robust security 
through stringent registration protocols but also provides educational tools for understanding and 
applying cryptographic techniques.
